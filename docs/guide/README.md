# Introduction

CSS is a language that determines how documents written in markup languages ​​such as HTML actually appear on your website. CSSIST automatically generates and manages CSS based on the class name of CSSIST in HTML. So you can develop by writing only the CSSIST class in markup such as HTML without writing CSS. As a CSS framework that doesn't write CSS for the first time, many advantages arise from not developing CSS.

## Advantages

- High degree of freedom
CSSIST supports values ​​in a variety of units, including percentage (%), px, em, vw, vh, HEX, RGB, RGBA, and calculation formula (calc). Among these, calculation formulas are the biggest advantage of CSSIST, and you can express values ​​with formulas as well as various values.

- Responsive
CSSIST allows you to specify MAX and MIN values ​​along with the class name, so you can develop all reactive types at once. Therefore, there is no need to develop separately for each device size with the existing media query, and the code is much reduced.

- Cross browsing
Several browsers are widely used today, including Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Explorer. Cross browsing is the unity of showing the same information across all browsers. CSSIST takes care of the cross-browsing process when creating a single class. Therefore, there is no need to cross-browse properties of all classes as in the existing CSS, and the code is much shorter because there is no duplicate code.

- event
There are numerous events in CSS such as Hover, Mouseenter, Mouseleave, Focus, and Blur. Any event supported by CSS that reacts to various events from the user is also available in CSSIST. Therefore, you do not need to specify a separate event class as in CSS.

- Maintenance

You can easily and quickly maintain it by changing only the CSSIST classes in the markup without worrying about the class name. Therefore, there is no need to name thousands of unnecessary classes like CSS.
