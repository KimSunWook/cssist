# Introduction

CSS is a language that determines how documents written in markup languages ​​such as HTML actually appear on your website. CSSIST automatically generates and manages CSS based on the class name of CSSIST in HTML. So you can develop by writing only the CSSIST class in markup such as HTML without writing CSS.
