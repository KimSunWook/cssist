## text-transform
- Class prefix: `tt`
- Values: `c | u | l  `

The text-transform CSS property specifies how to capitalize an element's text. It can be used to make text appear in all-uppercase or all-lowercase, or with each word capitalized. It also can help improve legibility for ruby.

### Syntax

```html
<div class="w-500px b-le300 bo-1px bo-be50 tt-l p-10px">
            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown 
    printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not 
    only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
    It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem 
    Ipsum.
</div>
