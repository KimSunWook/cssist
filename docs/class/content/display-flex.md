## display-flex
- Class prefix: `d-fx`

flex is a new value added to the CSS display property. Along with inline-flex it causes the element that it applies to to become a flex container, and the element's children to each become a flex item. The items then participate in flex layout, and all of the properties defined in the CSS Flexible Box Layout Module may be applied.

The flex property is a shorthand for the flexbox properties flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis.

In addition `flex` can refer to a flexible length in CSS Grid Layout.

### Syntax
```html

<div class="d-fx"></div> <!-- Equivalent to margin-right: 200px; -->
```
